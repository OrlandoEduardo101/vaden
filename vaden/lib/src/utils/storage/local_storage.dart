/// Implementation of the [Storage] interface that uses the local file system.
///
/// The LocalStorage class provides file storage capabilities using the local file system.
/// It stores files in a specified folder on the server's file system, making it suitable
/// for development environments or applications with simple storage needs.
///
/// This implementation is the simplest of the storage providers and doesn't require any
/// external services or credentials. However, it has limitations such as:
/// - Files are only accessible from the server where they are stored
/// - No built-in redundancy or backup mechanisms
/// - Limited scalability compared to cloud storage solutions
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final storage = LocalStorage('uploads');
///
/// // Upload a file
/// final filePath = await storage.upload('image.jpg', imageBytes);
///
/// // The file will be stored at 'uploads/[generated-uuid].jpg'
/// ```
///
/// Configuration in application settings:
/// ```yaml
/// storage:
///   provider: 'local'
///   local:
///     folder: 'uploads'
/// ```
class LocalStorage extends Storage {
  /// The path to the folder where files will be stored.
  ///
  /// This path can be absolute or relative to the current working directory.
  /// The folder will be created if it doesn't exist when the first file is uploaded.
  final String folderPath;

  /// Creates a new LocalStorage instance with the specified folder path.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [folderPath]: The path to the folder where files will be stored.
  LocalStorage(this.folderPath);

  /// Uploads a file to the local file system.
  ///
  /// This method generates a unique filename using UUID and the original file extension,
  /// creates the file in the specified folder, and writes the provided bytes to it.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [filePath]: The original file path, used to extract the file extension.
  /// - [bytes]: The contents of the file as a byte array.
  ///
  /// Returns:
  /// - A Future that resolves to the unique filename of the uploaded file.
  ///
  /// Throws:
  /// - [FileSystemException]: If the file cannot be created or written to.
