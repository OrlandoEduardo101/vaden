/// Configuration class for generating OpenAPI documentation in the Vaden framework.
///
/// The OpenApiConfig class collects and organizes information about the API endpoints,
/// data models, and other metadata needed to generate comprehensive OpenAPI documentation.
/// It works in conjunction with the OpenAPI annotations (such as @Api, @ApiOperation, etc.)
/// to provide a complete description of the API.
///
/// This class is typically used by the Vaden framework internally to generate OpenAPI
/// documentation automatically based on the annotations in your controllers and DTOs.
/// The generated documentation can be served as a JSON or YAML file and viewed using
/// tools like Swagger UI or Redoc.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// void main() async {
///   final app = await VadenApp.create();
///   
///   // Generate and serve OpenAPI documentation
///   app.useOpenApi();
///   
///   await app.listen();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// With the above setup, the OpenAPI documentation will be available at the '/api-docs'
/// endpoint, and a Swagger UI interface will be available at '/swagger'.
